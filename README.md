# GroceryStoreManagementSystem
The Grocery Store Management System is a Java-based desktop application with a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on grocery items. It uses a MySQL database to store and manage inventory information. This application is meant to be run locally on a user's computer and does not require hosting.

Features:

View Grocery Items:

Users can view a list of all grocery items in the inventory in a graphical interface.
Add Grocery Items:

Users can add new grocery items to the inventory with details such as name, price, and quantity through the GUI.
Update Grocery Items:

Users can edit the details of existing grocery items, including price and quantity, using the GUI.
Delete Grocery Items:

Users can remove grocery items from the inventory through the GUI.
Search and Filter:

Users can search for grocery items by name or category using the GUI.
Basic filtering options are available to find specific items quickly.
Technology Stack:

Language: Java
GUI Framework: JavaFX or Swing
Database: MySQL
JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) for database interactions.
Development Process:

Develop the Java application with a GUI (using JavaFX or Swing) for CRUD operations.
Utilize JDBC to connect to a local MySQL database and perform database operations.
Design and implement an appropriate database schema for storing grocery item information.
Document the codebase, including database schema and application usage instructions.
Deployment:

The application is intended to be run locally on a user's computer, so there's no need for hosting.
Users can download the application from a GitHub repository, set up the MySQL database locally, and run the application on their machines.
